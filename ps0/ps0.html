<h2>Problem Set 0: An introduction to <tt>ML</tt> and MIPS</h2>
<h3 align="left">
Due Friday, 13 Sep 2013, 11:59pm.</h3>
<hr>

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to expose you to programming in <tt>ML</tt> 
and to learn a few details of the MIPS instruction set architecture.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Instructions:</b> We have provided skeleton code which you can find 
<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~lib153/hw/ps0.zip">here</a>. Your job
is to fill in the parts of the skeleton code marked <tt>TODO</tt>. To submit your work,
create a zip archive containing all of the files provided in the original 
skeleton code distribution. Please run <tt>make clean</tt> to get rid of the
unnecessary binary files first.
</p><p>
Please name the zip archive <tt>ps0-lastname1-lastname2.zip</tt>, where 
lastname is replaced with you and your partner's last name. We require you to work with a partner
(there is a lot of code here).
</p><p>
If the zip archive does not compile with make, then they will not be accepted.  
If you are having trouble getting your code to compile, please post your issue
on <a href="http://piazza.com/harvard/fall2013/cs153">Piazza</a>, 
or come see a TF during office hours. If you run out of time, it's better to 
comment out the parts that aren't working than to submit something that won't compile.
</p><p>
For now, you can submit your assignment by emailing the zip archive to the TF
(email found on the course homepage). 
We are working on setting up a git-like repository which you can use to submit 
future assignments. Pay attention to the <a href="http://piazza.com/harvard/fall2013/cs153">Piazza</a> 
for any announcments on a change in submission process. In particular, we may
be releasing some basic test cases you can use as a sanity check, though you 
are encouraged to write your own testing framework.

</p><p>
There are two parts to this assignment. The first part consists of
writing a MIPS assembler. In the second part, you will implement
an interpreter for a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
</p><hr>

<h2>Part 1: MIPS Assembler</h2>

In this part, you will build an assembler for a subset of MIPS assembly. 
The assembler translates assembly code into machine code, the code that runs
on hardware. This exercise will demonstrate how we get from assembly code,
something that is still somewhat human-readable, to machine code. 

To do this part of the assignment, you will need to understand how MIPS assembly
is encoded at the level of bits. To this end, the MIPS documentation is your 
friend. You can find information about how to encode instructions (and
their semantics) in chapter A.10.2 (starting with page A-49) of the 
<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~lib153/HP_AppA.pdf">SPIM Simulator</a> chapter. 

Your job is to write the assem function in <tt>mips_sim.ml</tt>. 
<pre><b>let rec</b> assem (prog : program) : state
</pre>
At a high level, you will transform a list of assembly instructions, a program,
into an intial starting state. A state consists of a register file, memory and
program counter. Refer to the skeleton code for more information. 

<hr>
<h2>Part 2: MIPS Interpreter</h2>

In this part, you will build an interpreter for MIPS code,
similar to the SPIM simulator.  The goal of this exercise
is to become more familiar with the MIPS instruction set
architecture and to gain more experience writing ML code.

The interpreter is structured as a function:
<pre><b>let rec</b> interp (init_state : state) : state
</pre>
Your job is to write the interp function which simulates one step of 
execution at a time until program termination (for the purposes of this 
assignment, treat <tt>0x00000000</tt> as the program termination "instruction"). 
During a step, you should fetch a word's worth (4 bytes) of values from memory, starting at the address 
given by the program counter.  (It doesn't matter which Endian-ness you
pick, but be consistent.)

<p>
You should then decode the instruction
and perform the associated operation.  For example, if the
instruction bytes decode to an "<tt>add $1,$2,$3</tt>", then you
should update register one, with the sum of the values in 
registers two and three, and update the program counter so that it
points to the next instruction.

Look closely at the <tt>Int32</tt> module OCaml standard library as it provides
most of the functions that you will need for doing bit manipulation.

</p><p>
<b>Important!!</b> Note that the load immediate (<tt>li</tt>) instruction is a 
pseudoinstruction. This means that its ok to use it in a MIPS assembly program, 
with the caveat that MIPS hardware does not actually support this instruction. Instead,
the hardware supports a <tt>li</tt> instruction by encoding it as two instructions,
a <tt>lui</tt> and <tt>ori</tt>.

Thus, your assembler should accept any MIPS assembly
program that contains a <tt>li</tt> instruction, but your interp function should 
only accept <tt>lui</tt> and <tt>ori</tt> instructions to model the MIPS hardware.
